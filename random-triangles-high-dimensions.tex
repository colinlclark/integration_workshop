\section{Curse of dimensionality}

\textit{In Progress.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use a normal random number generator to create three random points in R2.
  \item Let these points be the vertices of a triangle. Compute the lengths and interior angles of the triangle.
  \item TODO: Find some simple measure of the `quality' of a triangle. (i.e. how close it is toe equilateral)
  \item Repeat, and histogram triange quality scores
\end{enumerate}

Repeat process for triangls in R10, (i.e. use a multivariate normal to generate 3 points in R10 and analze the triange.
Can you find an heuristic, geometric explanation for why the triangles in high dimensions are much closer to equilateral?
